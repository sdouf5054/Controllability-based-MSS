# Controllability-based-MSS

**Question**: Can we estimate time-varying controllability of vocal components to separate better?  
**Goal**: ISMIR 2026 submission (in progress)  
**Status**: Track A pipeline implemented (difficulty/proxies/cues + analysis) — Jan 2026

## Track A (current)
Pipeline (tables):
manifest → segments → separation → beat tracking → difficulty → proxies → cues → analysis
